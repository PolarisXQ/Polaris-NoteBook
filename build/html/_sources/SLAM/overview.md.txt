| Algorithm | Pros | Cons | Geometry | Device | Backend | Senser |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ORB-SLAM | Fast,Light,Robust | if parse, then unable to contruct a 2d grip map for navigation; if dense, too heavy？ | Point | | G2O | Various |
| SG-SLAM() | 2D-Semantic(ncnn), dynamic object elimination, real-time  | dense(otc) | Point | | G2O | RGBD |
| VINS-Mono | 行2列2 | 行2列3 | | | |
